# simple-2d-engine
Very Simple 2D engine with entity system which can have circle entities and polygons(shape created using vertices).
Collision detection and resolution is implemented using SAT(Separating Axis Theorem).

It is by no means optimized in any way or supposed to be used in any capacity.
I simply tried my hands on it for enjoyment and the learning aspect of it.
